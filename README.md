F95SOA-Translation: Son of Asia Translation Project
# Contribution Guidelines

Create an issue or pull request to claim a translation location

Alternatively, quote/DM me on the F95 forum

Claimed locations will be moved to an InProgress folder to prevent duplicate work

You can also get the old V60 translation from here: [https://github.com/f95Lok/SoA-LokScriptTranslation](https://github.com/f95Lok/SoA-LokScriptTranslation/tree/main/translated).  
The qsrc file names are not the same because I mixed DeepSeek/Google Translate.  


# Translation Recommendations
For machine translations, I recommend using Deepseek AI with DeepThink activated. While slower than other options, it delivers superior quality compared to Google Translate or ChatGPT and it is free(better than ChatGPT paid o1 model).

# VSCode Setup (Optional)

Install the custom plugin by:

Copying the qsrc folder to C:\Users\<USER>\\.vscode\extensions

Restarting VSCode

# Building QSP File

Will be released when the translation progress is somewhere between V60-70 content.
